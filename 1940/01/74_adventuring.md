# Adventuring

By Amy M. Rice

```
I do not live inside four walls;
I soar with thoughts of man
To peasant cot, or marble halls,
Or desert caravan.

I loiter in enchanted woods
And take my merry way
Along with fairies, knights, and kings
Through paths of yesterday.

I hear the echoes rise and fall
On distant snow-capped hills.
And pause beside a castle wall
To live a thousand thrills.

When tired or discouraged,
I go to Galilee
To hear the gentle voice of Him
Who stilled the angry sea.

Each day I joy in living,
For someone's magic pen
Will take me where I want to go
Adventuring again.

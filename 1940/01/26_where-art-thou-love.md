# Where Art Thou, Love?

```
I want thee, Love!
  Thy world is sweet with breath of mystery.
  Desire and promise glorify the air.
  Oh, sweep me from this sad mortality
  Into thy realm of beauty! Hear my prayer!

I see thee, Love!
  Because I see a meadow in the spring,
  A pansy bed—a thousand drops of dew;
  A bud into a flow'r is opening,
  A glorious world of wonders born anew.

I hear thee. Love!
  Because I hear the song of waking bird—
  Of distant stream—of whisp'ring, wind-blown leaves;
  The morning silence with unspoken word.
  Is filled with music that my heart receives.

I seek thee. Love!
  The way is hard, my soul needs comfort now;
  I wander far, but find no joy or rest;
  Could I but feel thy hand upon my brow,
  I'd know thy touch, and peace would end my quest.

I know thee. Love!
  My vision clears; the wond'rous, star-filled night,
  Has glorified the mortal earth He trod.
  Mine eyes can see, faith has restored my sight—
  I know thee now, dear Love, for thou art God!

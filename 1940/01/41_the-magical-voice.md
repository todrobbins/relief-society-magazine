# The Magical Voice

By Bess Foster Smith

```
A magical voice keeps repeating to me,
"Unlock your own prison; I give you the key."

"Before you a castle of happiness gleams.
With halls of contentment and beautiful dreams."

"O what is the signal that opens the gate?"
I ask all a-tremble to know my own fate.

The magical voice says, "Believe it is true,
Your faith swings the drawbridge so you can pass through."

# Parade

By Edith Lovell

```
I don't know why
I want to cry
When I see a parade
Go marching by;
I cannot see
Why I should be
So suffocated, so afraid
When people march light-heartedly.

Unless the beat
Of marching feet
Echoes upon the blood and grime
Of some far-off and ancient street;
Unless perhaps, this woman's heart
Remembers how to play the part
Of woman since the dawn of time
When soldiers off to battle start.

Or could it be
This heart of me
By some design has been endowed
With the gift of prophecy?
These foolish fears
For future years.
Could they be omens of a cloud
Which holds a flood of bitter tears?

Though mine may be a craven soul
A voice has whispered low to me:
"You were not given flesh and blood
And life to maim humanity."

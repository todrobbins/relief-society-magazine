# Another Year

By Mildred B. Hall

```
God gave me twelve full months of time,
Another year to use as mine;
But I was blind and could not see
The value of this legacy.
Through spring's awak'ning I lay mute.
And summer time bore me no fruit,
The pageant passed that was the fall,
And suddenly I saw it all.
My year had died, God called it home;
I hold its ashes tenderly, alone.

If God will grant this gift once more,
Another year to me restore,
I pledge my heart and hand to be
Of service to humanity.
Not by some deed of great display,
Just in a quiet, humble way;
I'll give a smile, or wipe a tear.
To heal a hurt or calm a fear.
I shall not ask of life for fame.
If God will grant Another Year, again.

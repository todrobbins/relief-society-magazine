# These Hills Are Home

## I
```
I must be gone. This alien sky is bright
With fluffs of frilled and frothy raimentings——
Gypsy-wild, garish, with unearthly rings
Of color and ethereal yellow light.
It smooths them softly, slowly, into dusk
Much as some pagan dancing-girl might fold
Her vivid trappings, their preposterous gold,
Sedately——scent them faintly with old musk.
Here is no home for one who loves the chill
And austere honor of bleak mountain crest
In winter—whose content is subtly pressed
From routine of odd seasons—and whose will
Bends to known rhythms, and confirms the rise
Of tempests darkening familiar skies.

## II
```
Beauty more magic I have never seen
Than where the fog lays woolly shawls around
The low slopes of Vallejo; and the sound
Of Eucalyptus leaves is like the clean
Sweet sound of desert rain which I have heard
Holding my breath for joy. White wings flash high
Where sea-birds glisten, settle, rise, and cry
Along Pacific shores. There is no word
To tell the majesty 'round blue Tahoe,
Or Carmel opulence, or how the bay
Silvers, and curls, and mists at Monterey:
No word so strangely rich; yet I must go.
I must be hearing when the fall winds stir
The stiff brown flowers of the home-hill fir.

These plumed and colored hills with thin blue veils
Curling across their foreheads dark——so fine
And rarely thin the eye more often fails
To see than sees them there——these hills are mine,
My home. And these deep valleys, I have grown
Indigenous to them. My body clings,
An eager, amourous lichen, to the stone
Which gives it sustenance. No siren sings
From sea-bluffs of far lands for me. I thought
Once to have climbed over and gone, but wind
Across the ledges of these hills has brought
Cedar, and sage, and pine, not tamarind
Or lotus odors. Oh, the wind is not
Aware of what these colored hills have wrought.

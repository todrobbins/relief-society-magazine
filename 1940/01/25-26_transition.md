# Transition

By Eddavene Zoan Houtz Bean

```
That I shall have my life to live
  (Oh, gift most rare!)
A song within my soul to give
  With love to share.
That I shall have the lilt of laughter
  In the joy of BEING
While o'er the hills and dales of life
  All beauty seeing.

That I shall STAND at sorrow's cross
  My mellowing heart, concealing,
While transition, by the upward reach,
  Infinite POWER revealing
That I shall lose my life——to FIND it.
  As the winter's pall
Precedes the bloom of spring, a prelude
  To the fruitful fall.

That I shall voice my praise and thanks
  To God, who gives.
For I KNOW the I, within me
  Does not die—but LIVES.

# Joy

```
It's joy to hear the wild birds' call
When wakening at flush of dawn;
While overwhelming fragrance waves
From dew-wet flowers and freshened lawn.

To see the morning sunshine splash
The window panes with golden light;
Forsythia nodding near the sill
An added happiness to sight.

To render service when of need.
Though small, perhaps a heart will sing
Both now and in the after years . . .
Remembering some little thing.

To find a folded, lifting grace
Within a bundle of distress:
Through faith and hope and busy hands
To bring from chaos, loveliness.

# Paul

By Annie Wells Cannon

```
He journeyed far,
  on persecution bent;
Tempestuous soul,
  torn with bitter hate!
When lo, behold!
  Before Damascus gate
He faltered, fell in terror
  and in fright
When 'round about him shined'
  a lustrous light.
Trembling and blind, he deemed
  his life was spent.
When through the thund'rous earth-quaked din
These anguished words in sorrow came to him:
"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
  Arise!
Thy mission lies
To lands beyond the sea
To testify
A darkened world of me."

To Antioch, Athens, Cyprus and Cyrene
And all the cities and the isles between.
In recompense
Paul took the word divine.
Nor wavered ever, as he testified
Of resurrected Christ——
  The crucified.

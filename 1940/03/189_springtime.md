# Springtime

```
The earth awakes from quiet rest and sleep,
And whitened valleys, hills, and rolling plains
Emerge from winter's shroud to bloom again.
The air is filled with song of birds that keep
Their promise of return. The bees now wing
Their way across the meadows. One by one
New forms of life unfolding to the sun
Have brought about the glories of the spring.

Can man not find the answer to his life
In nature's blooming season now at hand.
And free his days from forceful rush and strife
And walk serenely to the better land?
The light of reason cannot fail to see
There is no death. Spring comes eternally.

# Loss

By Miranda Snow Walton

```
A pine tree knows not winter's desolation,
It stands unscathed beneath the ice and snow;
It does not feel the stinging pain of parting
With leaves and buds it bore a year ago.
But when the winter's gone, and earth is waking
To apple orchards bravely blossoming,
A pine tree prays for rapture of reunion,——
It cannot know the glory of the spring.

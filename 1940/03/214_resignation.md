# Resignation

By Irene R. Davis

```
I am weary when the night does fall;
My soul is oppressed when I see all
The tasks I have left undone.

A garment torn, a finger print
Where wee hands want to stray;
And though I yearn for careless ease,
My duties say me, "Nay."

My spirit would in fancy flit
Across the meadows clear.
My heart goes dancing with the breeze,
And fairy bells I hear.

But, I must stay at home to clean;
An upturned face I kiss,
A smudgy tear I wipe away.
But I should cherish this——

I have a neighbor 'cross the way,
And oh, she envies me!
She would give a world of joys to share
The little cares I see.

And so——
I am weary when the night does fall;
But I thank God I have them all—
My Cares!

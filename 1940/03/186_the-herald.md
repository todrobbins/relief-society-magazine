# The Herald

By Merling D. Clyde

```
March, you're here again to woo us,——
Frowns, and then your winning smile.
By your petulance we know you;
See the changeling through the guile.
Every smile you gaily bring us
Only makes our hearts more glad.
Not a frown you roughly toss us
Ever makes our hearts grow sad.

Winter calls adieu through you, March;
Summer sings a bright good-day.
In transition you are precious.
Romp, you merry Month, I pray.
You can't daunt us with your bluster
Or your winds that wildly sing.
Oh, we call your bluff, you herald.
March, you bring to us the spring.

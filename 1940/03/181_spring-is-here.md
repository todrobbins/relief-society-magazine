# Spring is Here

```
The raindrops tapping on the ground
Say: "Spring is here! Spring is here!"
The robins nesting all around
Chirp: "Spring is here! Spring is here!"
And boys with marble, top, and kite.
The string a-tug with all its might,
Shout: "Spring is here! Spring is here!"

And every bud a-top the trees
Sighs: "Spring is here! Spring is here!"
Soft winds the tangled branches tease
With: "Spring is here! Spring is here!"
And romping girls with skipping rope
Sing gaily with the happy hope
That: "Spring is here! Spring is here!"

When Winter wraps his cloak to go.
Spring is here! Spring is here!
The farmer in his field calls:
"Ho! Spring is here! Spring is here!"
While fleecy clouds go drifting by.
The lazy sun wakes up to cry:
"Spring is here! Spring is here!"

# April Rain

By J. B. Jennings

```
Upon the fields of April
  The gentle-falling rain
Descends with touch as tender
  As that which eases pain;
Falls lightly on the hayland
  And softly in the grain
And glistens on the willows
  That dwell along the lane.
Then, hark, upon the mountain.
  And sweetly on the plain.
The long, low hush and murmur——
  The sound of April rain.

# Liberate the Flame

By Anna Prince Redd

```
A talent hid, not used, is like a case
That, full of gems and fabulous in worth.
Is closed and locked, the key hid deep in earth.
Within——dull rocks——the stones all lie; the space.
A tomb of cold and rayless black. To grace
With scintillating warmth they must have birth
In light, full ray of sun beneath the girth
Of fast-bound lid, the darkness to efface.

And I have found the key. I'll lift the lid:
The ray but strikes my soul-fire into flame.
My talents are my jewels; used not hid.
They daily grow in beauty—this the key.
Though it unlock no worldly wealth or fame
I cannot estimate its worth to me.

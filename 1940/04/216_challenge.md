```
Green-bannered spring——this bank of daffodils——
Whose sun-filled graciousness, unmeasured, spills
From up-turned cups of gold——and beauty's wraith
Is here. Oh, little sturdy seeds of faith.
If you can draw from mud and rotted mould.
From long-drawn winter's dark, unfruited cold
And gather strength where last year's ruins lie
To make a lovely thing——so, then, can I.

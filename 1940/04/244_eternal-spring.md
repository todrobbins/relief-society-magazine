# Eternal Spring

```
Help me to change as the seasons do.
Oh, God, with grace and poise.
Spring has come with life anew
Enriched by hopes and joys.

Summer is here. Help me to give
And labor for all whom I can aid.
That when the frosts of autumn come
Life's pattern will be made.

Grant that its colors will be varied,
Glowing with warming shades,
As the mantle on the mountain
When summer sunlight fades.

Then when the snows of winter fall
With white upon my brow.
Oh, God, the faith within my soul
Tells me I'll see spring again
As surely as the planets roll.

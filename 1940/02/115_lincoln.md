# Lincoln

```
Born of pioneer blood and soil.
Nurtured and trained by a life of toil
Cultured and graced from an inner light.
Chosen of God to defend the right.
Silent and mute, he walked apart,
Hopes and yearnings locked deep in his heart.

Words cannot tribute this God-given life.
Shining through darkness, struggle, and strife;
Mightier far than the words of pen
Triumphs his name in the hearts of men.
Symbol of brotherhood, charity, love.
Faith in the right arid His Maker above.

# Hidden Song

By Marguerite Burnhope Harris

```
Somewhere within my heart there is a song,
  But I don't hear or feel its rhythmic call;
Its music does not touch my soul at all
  For night has come, and for a time so long
There has been leaden gray where songs belong.
  Yet still I know 'tis there beyond a wall
That some day will be crushed, and crumbling fall,
  And forth will come a melody and dawn.

For always light doth follow after dark.
  And hidden songs do find their joyous way
To gladden hearts as sunshine brightens day.
  And then I, too, will sing as does the lark
When morning comes to spread its glorious light
  Upon a world that is no longer night.

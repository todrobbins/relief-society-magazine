# For Feet Must Follow

```
O, may my heart go singing, Pioneers,
  That song of courage which your hearts began!
Sharpen my feelings till my spirit hears
  That one of steel which held you to your plan.

O, shape a Zion for my eyes, and let
  Me cherish truth far reaching as the dawn!
For feet must follow where the heart is set
  And find the goal the eye is fixed upon.

And let pride lend my song a quickened beat,
  Pride in my heritage, this sacred trust;
But add an undertone of trudging feet.
  The thud of oxen plodding through the dust.

Give it the peace that marks the furrow's seam,
  The clip of chisels, and the hammer's ring;
But over all let faith to see your dream
  And gratitude be in the song I sing.

# Give of Thyself

By Hortense Spencer Andersen

```
With only a modest urge at reckoning
The significance of such emblazonment,
Man stands again, incuriously content,
Beholding his inheritance, the Spring.
He witnesses the lavish blossoming
Of that which only yesterday seemed spent,
Without divining the magnificent
Design contrived to quicken him, earth's king.

He, also, could repeat his flowerings
Of spirit, service, virtue, energy
In season, as the endless other things
Of earth, if he in his maturity
But spent himself, as freely as a rose tree flings
Its petals. . . . But some give but partially.

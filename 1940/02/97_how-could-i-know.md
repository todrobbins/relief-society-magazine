# How Could I Know?

By Anna Prince Redd

```
I knew they loved me——John and Jack and Paul.
But John was smug, and Jack was dull, Paul, meant
For country lass. While I, so elegant.
Would love no one of them, I thought, at all.
I loved a handsome suitor, stately, tall.
Whose dark smooth head above my curls was bent,
Whose arms around me, trembling, left me spent
With rapture, breathless, answering love's call.

But that was, oh, so long ago, my dear,
When I was young, and dreaming, quite the thing.
How could I know what future years would bring.
Or that tonight, still dreaming, I'd be sitting here
With you close by? And——yes, there in the glass,
I see myself, Paul dear, your country lass.
